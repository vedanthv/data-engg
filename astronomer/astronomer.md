## Module 1 - Intro to Astro CLI

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/2f5e1fc3-f288-499b-adaa-6568e90cc7db)

### Setting Up and Running Astro CLI?

- Astro CLI uses docker to setup and run local dev environment.
- Two Commands to execute are:
    - ```dev init``` to init the local dev envt
    - ```dev start``` to spin up airflow instance

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/a8cc18a2-c300-4898-8aba-093a0dc26bca)

There are four docker images **Web Server**,**Scheduler**,**Database** and **Triggerer** that are part of a Docker Container called Astronomer Runtime.

### Pushing the DAG to the Production Envt

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/11963165-96b8-4b5d-a36f-abbe836431dc)

- A request is sent to the Airflow API saying that we need to update the airflow instance of a deployment, a docker image is created with our DAGs and pushed
into the registry.

- Then finally the Aiirflow instance in the data plane is restarted with the new docker instances with DAGs

### Installing Astro CLI

Docs : [Click Here](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/install-cli?tab=windowswithwinget#install-the-astro-cli)

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/3a17ef3d-5fe5-4418-94c0-1351069f1187)

## Module 2 - Airflow Concepts

### Creating a Project

- ```mkdir astro && cs astro```

- ```astro dev init```

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/67400781-8f0d-4a48-a2b5-c700feb18a70)

- ```airflow_settings.yaml``` allows us to recrete a project without creating variables and connections over and over again.

### Running Airflow

- ```astro dev start``` spins up airflow and downloads the docker images for airflow components.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/6a541aae-c382-4f43-8c4b-c5171d9e77e3)

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/1023fe8b-c00d-4897-b64f-8744ea1c5bac)

### Add additional providers in Airflow

- On astro terminal type ```astro dev run providers list``` to check the list of all the providers.

- if anything is not installed, pip install it from the providers page in the UI and add it to the reqs file.

### Upgrading Astro Runtime

Go to Dockerfile and change the version then run ```asto dev restart```

### Non Base Images v/s Base Image

By default we have the non base image where the folders and dependencies are auto copied to the docker container but if we want to have full control of everything
and add whatever folders we want, we have to use the base image.

We can switch to the base image by changing the command in Dockerfile to ```FROM quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:5.3.0-base```

### Persisting Variables after killing Airflow Image

Check how to do this [here](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101/local-development-environment/1569583)

### Environment Variables

In the ```.env``` file we can specify the name of the environment as ```AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__INSTANCE__NAME = ProdEnv```

If we want to keep mutiple environments just add one more file ```.dev``` and add ```ENVIRONMENT = dev``` in that file. 

Now we can start the server with this env, ```airflow dev start --env .dev```

This is only valid in our local environment.

If we want too export the environment variables to the Astro instance, then we need to add ```ENV AIFLOW__WEBSERVER__INSTANCE__NAME = ProdEnv``` to the Dockerfile.

### Checking DAGs for Errors before Running it

If we dodnt want to wait for 5-6 min for the UI to throw up any import or other errors then we can use ```astro dev parse``` to get all the possible errors in 
the command line itself.

We can also use the pytest library for testing using ```astro dev pytest```

Another way to run and compile dags in the cli is ```astro run```. This Trigger a single DAG run in a local Airflow environment and 
see task success or failure in your terminal. This command compiles your DAG and runs it in a single Airflow worker container based on your 
Astro project configurations.

More type of testing like backtesting dependencies during updates is [here](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/test-your-astro-project-locally)

### How Everything Works?

Step 1 : 
![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/15b456bc-9483-4f16-948a-bb668ae16212)

Step 2 : 
![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/a6ea0d2f-44b3-4ead-9786-450ffed0839a)

Scheduler processes the DAG and we may need to wait upto 5 min before getting the new DAG on the Airflow UI.

Step 3:
![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/482ac766-06b0-4ee2-b7ed-f3dbf34ff5f4)
The scheduler creates the DAGRun Object that has the states running.

Step 4:
![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/08ca70cb-5b40-40d3-a36f-bd36f461e25f)

The scheduler then creates the task instance which is instance of the task at a certain time and it has the state scheduled.

Step 5:
![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/8704266e-8ca1-4ce2-93b3-2bc1adfc3853)

Now the Task Instance is queued and the scheduler sends the taskInstance object to the executor that executes it and the state of the task is complete.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/9c62f248-c618-4257-9c7d-3da847e7b3b1)

Now either the task status is success or failed and it updates the state accordingly.

Then the scheduler checks whether the work is done or not.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/7cd5614e-cb73-4d13-8ec0-0d33d48915d6)

Finally the Airflow UI is updated.

Check the [video](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101/astro-runtime-airflow-concepts/1273942) also.

## Module 3  : Airflow UI

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/1576865a-6152-4c4d-b25e-4cc7b5c43d81)

Here the long vertical line is the DagRun Object and the short boxes are the Task Instances.

Landing time view illustrates how much time each task takes and we can check if optimizations applied are efficient or not.

**Gantt Charts**

These charts show how much time it took to run the DAG. 

Grey color means that the DAG was queued and green means the DAG was running and completed.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/1c066fde-edd0-4efe-8731-7daf0f0f176b)

In this image, the second DAG took the longest to run.

## Module 4 : Simple DAG

- Catchup : Catchup refers to the process of scheduling and executing all the past DAG runs that would have been scheduled if the DAG had been created and running at an earlier point in time.

### Create DAG with Traditional Paradigm

with is a context manager
```
from airflow import DAG
from datetime import datetime

with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 1 , 1),
         description='A simple tutorial DAG', tags=['data_science'],
         schedule='@daily', catchup=False):
```

### Using the TaskAPI

@dag is a decorator

```
from airflow.decorators import dag
from datetime import datetime

@dag(start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), description='A simple tutorial DAG', 
     tags=['data_science'], schedule='@daily', catchup=False)
def my_dag():
    None

my_dag()
```

### Defining a Python Operator Task

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/3d99e0b0-2f56-46f4-b371-92237ae0bd0c)

### DAG without context manager with

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/ee4216ff-7d7b-47a9-b5e1-a5db44ff4d0b)

Much simpler method with TaskFlowAPI

```
from airflow.decorators import dag, task
from datetime import datetime

@dag(start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), description='A simple tutorial DAG', 
     tags=['data_science'], schedule='@daily', catchup=False)
def my_dag():
    
    @task
    def print_a():
        print('hi from task a')
```

### Chain Dependencies

First Import ```from airflow.util.helpers imoprt chain```

```task_a >> [task_b,task_c,task_d] >> task_e```

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/499d250a-7fd6-4c8b-979b-595b9d0797ff)

```chain(task_a,[task_b,task_c],[task_d,task_e])```

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/dfca384f-1c14-41ce-9cce-172c9df79bb6)

### Setting Default Args

```
default_args = {
    'retries': 3,
}
```

### Dependencies with Task Flow API

```
from airflow.decorators import dag, task
from datetime import datetime
from airflow.utils.helpers import chain


@dag(start_date=datetime(2023, 1 , 1),
         description='A simple tutorial DAG', tags=['data_science'],
         schedule='@daily', catchup=False)
def my_dag():

    @task
    def print_a():
        print('hi from task a')
    
    @task
    def print_b():
        print('hi from task b')

    @task
    def print_c():
        print('hi from task c')

    @task
    def print_d():
        print('hi from task d')

    @task
    def print_e():
        print('hi from task e')


    print_a() >> print_b() >> print_c() >> print_d() >> print_e()

my_dag()

```

### Assignment : Creating DAG with Bash Operator

The DAG should look like this:

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/ec52175b-ff94-4b34-b9cd-fa2556a34b8d)

```
from airflow import DAG
from datetime import datetime
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator

with DAG(dag_id='check_dag', schedule='@daily', 
        start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), catchup=False,
        description='DAG to check data', tags=['data_engineering']):
    
    create_file = BashOperator(
        task_id='create_file',
        bash_command='echo "Hi there!" >/tmp/dummy'
    )

    check_file_exists = BashOperator(
        task_id='check_file_exists',
        bash_command='test -f /tmp/dummy'
    )

    read_file = PythonOperator(
        task_id='read_file',
        python_callable=lambda: print(open('/tmp/dummy', 'rb').read())
    )

    create_file >> check_file_exists >> read_file
```

## Module 6 : Sheduling DAGs

### What is a DAGRun?

- When the scheduler schedules the tasks to run, a DAG Run object is created with ```data_interval_start``` and ```data_interval_end```

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/ac9118ac-62fb-4177-beef-8558e21bd995)

First the DAGRun is is in the Queued state, once the first task runs its in the running state.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/da907040-0a9d-4dc0-a10e-603c095cfeba)

Final task state determines the end state of the DAGRun.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/95ca158a-4985-4a72-90e1-3bc390797a2c)

**Properties of DAG Run**

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/08649391-4997-4076-a9ab-8202d8a662c2)

### How DAGs are scheduled?

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/f83699c2-18cf-458e-8358-c05c9eabd0f9)

**Example of three DAG runs**

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/9d6b73d0-d3ef-4842-a53b-b3a4e7f7e743)

**Thing to Remember**

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/05db8110-e7b2-47f4-83cd-765f863b346a)

### The ```start_date``` parameter

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/cd8aa7a7-18d7-4db4-8306-2bc052229285)

#### How it works?

**Scenario I**

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/f8bdc6a7-6f97-4c66-8163-94f80c3330d7)

- Let's say there are three dag runs from start date until now.

- Today if we hit the trigger on the dag...

- Then all the other previous dag runs from the start date till now are run.

- This happens only for the first time that we run the dag.

**Scenario II**

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/960914cf-4ad5-4703-bedb-1edf4497f1b9)

- Let's say we made a mistake and stopped the DAG on 2nd Jan 2022,

- We fix it and then restart the DAG.

- In this case Airflow backfills the DAG from the last run and not the start date.

- So the dag is backfilled only from 2nd Jan and not 1st Jan.

### Cron Expressions for ```schedule_interval```

use [crontab.guru](crontab.guru) website to construct cron expressions

cron expressions take into account day light saving time.

how to trigger dags every three days?

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/fad972bc-c576-4844-9840-8e7fc662c794)

Check the [link](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101/astro-runtime-scheduling/1555646) for a complete summary.

### Concept Of Catchup

The scheduler runs all the previous DAGRuns between now and the date @ which the DAG was triggeres or the start date of the DAG.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/18d0a9fb-3630-49ad-b887-9aaafa6273cf)

### Backfilling Process

In the figure below we can see that there are DAGRuns that are alreasy triggered and executed from start_date until now.

But what if we want to trigger the DAGs that are before the start date?

We can do this with the backfilling mechanism.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/a043a36f-0894-43e7-88be-185abcf379a0)

## Module 5 : Connections In Airflow

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/e8adae05-418f-4e4a-8194-c2007c5e8ed0)

To Interact with external systems like APIs we need Connections. They are a set of parameters such as login and password that are encrypted.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/6eb58c81-c0f3-43e8-a08c-c4cd37d9e883)

If we want to interact with a software appln via a connection we need to install its provider first. dbt has its own provider, snowflake has its provider...

### How to create a connection?

Go to Admin > Connections > Create New Connection (+ button)

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/8bf6b66a-4ea4-4a30-af04-2f399a15bbd9)

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/5746e495-6f65-433a-b15f-f51a46caba4a)

Password is the API Key from Calendarific Docs

After Clicking on Save the connecton appears on the page

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/8b60066e-f839-449e-8559-2e9b71e57395)

Check out the [Registry](registry.astronomer.io) to check the docs and parameters for any tool.

We can export environment variables using the .env file and give parameters there, no need UI for this. Check this [Snowflake Example](https://academy.astronomer.io/connections-101/1277466)

To deploy the connections use ```astro deployment variable create --deployment-id <ID> --load --env .env```

### Pain Points with Connections

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/471a7282-0e97-48c5-a586-c4d116d83777)

#### Cannot share the connections from Dev to Prod Environment.

With Astro we can create a **Connection Managementment Environment** to manage the connections.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/536bcd5f-bce5-4329-b8a8-887803ac5178)

#### Specific Forms For Each Connection Type

Astro unlike Airflow provides us with custom forms for each connection type.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/42ee370d-0927-4cea-b0f7-881dda5d40fb)

#### There is no Inheritance Model

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/b9c29033-2bfc-4ad2-b8e6-25b6fe6da2c7)

In the above image we can see that most of the parameters in Dev Deployment and Prod Deployment are identical except the DB name. But with Airflow we cannot inherit the variables.

This is solved by Astro.

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/d49ce512-72af-4c66-9fd1-17bcbaa61b3f)

#### There is no Secret Backend
There is no secret vault storage that is encrypted in Airflow, we need to create our own but in Astro it comes in built.

### Use Case : Sharing Connections wih=th Dev Deployment and Local Dev Environments

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/7e93f39d-4151-425b-8c05-e806bf32b23f)

You can check out the [Snowflake Example](https://academy.astronomer.io/connections-101/1820300) of creating a Connection Management System in Astro Cloud, then enabling the local dev environments to access the secrets using a set of commands.

## Module 7 - XCom

Suppose there are two tasks A and B. We want to send a file from A to B.

We can use an external system like S3 bucket where task A can upload it to the bucket and then task B can download it.

We can use a native way using XCom(Airflow Meta DB)

![image](https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engg/assets/44313631/912756d0-d44b-4eec-96bc-633f81fee0a0)

### Pulling Multiple Values @ once

Here we can see that keys for both the tasks are the same, this is allowed because the XComs is defined not only by key but the dag_id and task_id also

### Limitations of XCom

If we use SQLLite, we can share at most one gb in a given XCom, for PostGres its 1 gb for a given Xcom.

If we use MySQL, we can share atmost 64kb in a given XCom.

**So XCom is great for small data and it must be JSON Serializable.**

**Example DAG Covering All Concepts**

```
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
import pendulum
from airflow.models.taskinstance import TaskInstance as ti



def _transform(ti: ti):
   import requests
   resp = requests.get(f'https://swapi.dev/api/people/1').json()
   print(resp)
   my_character = {}
   my_character["height"] = int(resp["height"]) - 20
   my_character["mass"] = int(resp["mass"]) - 13
   my_character["hair_color"] = "black" if resp["hair_color"] == "blond" else "blond"
   my_character["eye_color"] = "hazel" if resp["eye_color"] == "blue" else "blue"
